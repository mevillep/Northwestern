Requirements:
Create a search page that displays the returned results alphabetically.

Use a HTML5, CSS3 two-column layout with a header and footer. You can use placeholder text in content areas (Lorem Ipsum).

Execute an AJAX call for the search to an outside API (You Tube, MeetUp, Google Books, Yelp, etc.) or to a local file containing search results (JSON), and display the results.

This should work well across modern web browsers and devices.

The layout should be fluid/responsive.

Try not using jQuery to build the search feature. Now is the time to show off some JavaScript MV* framework skills. JavaScript Unit Tests are welcomed but not required. Think of it as extra credit.


Usage:

clone the project or download the zip file.
The project is requesting an external API "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users" for the JSON data.

After running the index page, you will see the login screen. Enter email as "user@northwestern.com" and password as "password"
You will see the list of employers that we have requested from the external API displayed on the screen.
